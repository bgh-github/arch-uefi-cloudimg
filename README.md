# Arch UEFI Cloud Image (arch-uefi-cloudimg)

A (unofficial) minimal, [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io) enabled [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) virtual machine image build for UEFI booting on latest generation VM hardware.

The runtime target for arch-uefi-cloudimg is "modern" specification [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/proxmox-ve) (or more generally [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org)/KVM) VM hardware. Specifically, QEMU VMs configured with UEFI (OVMF) boot, Q35 chipset, paravirtualised VirtIO storage and network etc.

The above GitHub Actions workflow automatically refreshes the image around midnight UTC+0 each day. Downloads will remain openly available so long as CDN bandwidth costs don't get out of hand.

## Local Build

It should also be possible to generate the image locally by executing `./build-img.sh <output_path>` on an Arch-based machine. For example, `./build-img.sh /tmp/arch-uefi-cloudimg`.

The machine running the build must have internet connectivity and the following packages installed at a minimum - `gptfdisk`, `base-devel`/`sudo`, `dosfstools`, `arch-install-scripts`, `qemu-img`.

## What's Included

In short, not much. And that's kind of the idea.

In the Arch [spirit](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux#Principles) of simplicity and minimalism, the only packages included out of the box with arch-uefi-cloudimg are `base`, `linux`, `zram-generator`, `openssh`, `cloud-init`, and `cloud-guest-utils`. The main reason arch-uefi-cloudimg exists is to solve a bootstrapping problem. Its job is really to do just enough to facilitate VM boot and early initialisation, at which point a full configuration management solution would take over.

Typically, the VM provisioning process would go something like

1. Use cloud-init to prime the absolute essentials for the environment, such as network configuration, SSH keys, and any management agents
2. Once the VM is in a manageable state, have a configuration management tool handle subsequent setup

In this way, arch-uefi-cloudimg is intentionally a blank canvas.

The slightly opinionated part is perhaps the eschewment of "legacy" technologies and including + enabling `zram-generator`. On balance, this seemed reasonable with consensus on the age-old "to swap or not to swap" question appearing to converge towards zram (see [Fedora change](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/SwapOnZRAM)), zram being relatively trivial to disable post-provisioning, no upfront partitioning implications, and the assumption modern virtualised workloads would be flash storage backed.

## Running

With the image downloaded (and verified), it's now time to spin up a VM. Command line examples provided below for Proxmox VE and local QEMU. These same principles can be adapted to various deployment tooling/APIs as appropriate.

<details>
  <summary>Proxmox VE</summary>

  Transfer image and `cloud-config.yml` file containing any custom cloud-init vendor/user data to PVE host

  ```bash
  pve=user@pve.lan.example.com

  scp arch-uefi-cloudimg.qcow2 "${pve}:/var/lib/vz/images/arch-uefi-cloudimg.qcow2"
  scp cloud-config.yml "${pve}:/var/lib/vz/snippets/cloud-config.yml"
  ```

  Use PVE host shell to create VM, set cloud-init values, import image, and boot

  ```bash
  storage=local-zfs

  vmid=123
  name=example

  ```bash

  qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -enable-kvm \
    -cpu host \
    -smp cores=2 \
    -m 2G \
    -machine q35 \
    -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly=on,file=/usr/share/ovmf/x64/OVMF_CODE.fd \

    -drive file=arch-uefi-cloudimg.qcow2,if=none,id=scsi0 \
    -nic user,model=virtio-net-pci \
    -cdrom cloud-init.iso
  ```

</details>

In either case

* cloud-init should take care of growing the root partition into available space
* `cloud-config.yml` may include something like

  ```yaml
  #cloud-config
  locale: en_US.UTF-8
  timezone: US/Eastern
  packages: qemu-guest-agent
  runcmd:
    - systemctl enable --now qemu-guest-agent
  ```

## Related Projects

### [Arch-boxes](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/arch-boxes)

The official source of cloud-ready Arch VM images. This was the first thing I turned up in the search for a ready to run Arch cloud image.

Testing, I discovered the images were only BIOS (MBR) compatible and wouldn't boot on my chosen VM hardware.

Finding an [issue](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/arch-boxes/-/issues/141) about adding hybrid BIOS+UEFI support, I set out to see if this was something I could tackle. Eventually coming to the realisation that, given my requirements, the added complexity to maintain legacy BIOS support and fiddling with GRUB (when simpler UEFI-only boot loader alternatives like systemd-boot exist) etc. wasn't something I wanted to pursue.

### [Arch Installer](https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall)

Aka the optional `archinstall` installer included on Arch media. It supports guided installation as well as automation through configuration files and a Python library.

If it hadn't of been for archinstall I mightn't have got my original start with Arch. While very useful in guided install scenarios, experimenting with archinstall I increasingly felt it was a bit too "heavy", and the various options not really necessary for building a basic cloud image. I did also encounter an inconsistency here or there with configuration files not behaving as expected.

### [mkosi](https://github.com/systemd/mkosi)

A utility under the systemd project banner used to create custom operating system images.

I stumbled upon this very late just prior to wrapping up work on arch-uefi-cloudimg. The tool appears to provide a high degree of flexibility if the goal is to build images for several OS flavours. Another plus it being built with an eye towards systemd-nspawn containers and secure boot. It also appears to share a similar ["legacy-free"](https://0pointer.net/blog/mkosi-a-tool-for-generating-os-images.html) philosophy to arch-uefi-cloudimg.

While yet to properly explore mkosi, I'd like to think arch-uefi-cloudimg still has its place in striking a balance between aligning to the official ArchWiki [Installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide) and doing what's necessary to automate modern cloud-ready Arch Linux VM image creation.
